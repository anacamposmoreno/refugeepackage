Description: The aim of this package is to discard unsuitable areas for setting refugee camps. Around 6.6 million people live in refugee camps. Among them, 4.5 million reside in planned and 
    managed camps and approximately 2 million are sheltered in self-settled camps. The decision of the spot where these camps are based can be live changing. This package was built to help make this decision as fast as possible. 
    A suitable camp should provide easy access to water, be in a safe spot and have sufficient space for people to live with dignity among other many things. These three conditions are secured with different functions. 
    The access to water is ensured by the presence of a stream. 
    How safe a spot is was measured with an inequality indicator, being the areas with the lower inequality value, the safest ones. 
    The possibility to create a large camp is linked with a low population density.
    Of course, many more functions would have to by built to ensure that a place is, indeed, suitable to host a refugee camp, but places that do not meet these initial conditions are likely to be discarded after thorough study.
